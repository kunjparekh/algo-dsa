==> Auxiliry space complexity(ASC) :
  - It's basically gives the depth of the recursion.
  - Suppose you are finding fibbonaci series using recursion and if you are finding f(6) then accroding to recurrsion f(6) calls 
    f(5) then f(5) calls f(4) and so on... so any number n there are at max n functions(executions) are waiting in computer 
    stack so the total ASC go down to O(N). Similarally for finding ASC for any code see the depth in stack.
